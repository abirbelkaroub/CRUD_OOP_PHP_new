## Project Structure
The application follows a simple MVC architecture:

- **Controller** → Handles application logic and user requests

## CRUD Operations Flow
### Create (Insert)
User submits a task
→ Controller receives the request
→ Model inserts data into the database
→ Database stores the task

### Read (Display)
View requests all tasks  
→ Model executes a SELECT query
→ Database returns tasks
→ View displays them

### Update
User clicks update on a specific task
→ Task ID is sent through the URL
→ Controller retrieves task data
→ User edits the task
→ Model updates the database

### Delete
User clicks delete on a task
→ Task ID is sent to the controller
→ Model deletes the task from the database
